        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>This project was created to explore the affordability of housing in select zip codes throughout the United States.<br>
        Median sales price information was pulled from Zillows database and affordability scores were calculated using the<br>
        National Association of Realtors formula for Housing Affordability. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Housing Affordability Index = (Median Salary / Qualifying Salary) * 100</p>
        <p>Where Median Salary was pulled from the Census Bureau's Annual community survey for 2017, with a value of $63,000. <br>
        Qualifying Salary was calculated using the Monthly Mortgage Payment of the median sales price in each zip code, with 20% down payment.<br>
        </p>
        <p>This project is powered by a Flask backend, NoSQL database, and D3.js frontend. <br>
        The code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jristow/capstoneProject-ServiceLayer">GitHub</a></p>
